# 🔬 Evaluation System - Setup Guide

Quick guide to set up and use the OpenAI LLM-as-a-judge evaluation system.

## ✅ What You Have Now

A comprehensive evaluation system with:
- **OpenAI GPT-4** as an expert judge
- **Domain-specific** rule-based checks
- **Pipeline integration** for automated quality gates
- **A/B testing** framework
- **Pre-built test cases** for ticketing scenarios

---

## 🚀 Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install openai>=1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Set Your OpenAI API Key
```bash
# Add to your environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here

# Or add to .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here" >> .env
```

### Step 3: Run Evaluation
```bash
cd evals
python3 eval_suite.py
```

---

## 📊 What Happens When You Run It

### The eval suite will:

1. **Initialize** both evaluators (GPT-4 + domain checks)
2. **Run 9 test cases** covering:
   - Simple purchases
   - Seat upgrades
   - Price inquiries
   - Complex requests
   - Refunds

3. **Evaluate each response** on:
   - Helpfulness (is it useful?)
   - Accuracy (is it correct?)
   - Appropriateness (professional tone?)
   - Tool usage (right tools?)
   - Conversation flow (natural?)
   - Domain expertise (ticketing knowledge?)
   - PLUS: Price math, inventory validation, policy compliance

4. **Generate report** showing:
   ```
   ✅ Passed: 9/9 (100%)
   📊 Avg score: 0.89/1.00
   💡 Recommendation: READY FOR PRODUCTION
   ```

5. **Save results** to `eval_results.json`

## 🎯 Key Use Cases

### 1. Before Deploying New Model
```bash
# Evaluate your endpoint before production
python3 evals/pipeline_integration.py

# If score >= 0.85 and pass rate >= 0.90:
# → Deploy to production ✅

# If not:
# → More training needed ❌
```

### 2. Compare Two Models (A/B Testing)
```python
from evals import PipelineEvaluator

evaluator = PipelineEvaluator(project_id, region, bucket)

comparison = evaluator.compare_endpoints(
    endpoint_a_id="current-model",
    endpoint_b_id="new-model",
    test_cases=test_cases
)

print(f"Winner: {comparison['winner']}")
# Automatically choose better model!
```

### 3. Test Specific Response
```python
from evals import LLMJudge

judge = LLMJudge()

result = judge.evaluate_response(
    user_message="I need 2 tickets",
    agent_response="Great! Section B has 2 seats for $180 each. Total: $360",
    tools_used=["check_inventory"]
)

print(f"Overall: {result.overall_score:.2f}")
print(f"Feedback: {result.feedback}")
```

## 📈 Understanding Scores

### Overall Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 0.90 - 1.00 | Excellent | ✅ Deploy to production |
| 0.80 - 0.89 | Good | ✅ Deploy with monitoring |
| 0.70 - 0.79 | Acceptable | ⚠️ Deploy to staging only |
| 0.60 - 0.69 | Poor | 🔧 Needs improvement |
| Below 0.60 | Failing | ❌ Requires retraining |

### Dimension Scores

- **Helpfulness** < 0.80 → Improve task completion
- **Accuracy** < 0.80 → Fix hallucinations, verify data
- **Tool Usage** < 0.80 → Better tool selection logic
- **Domain Expertise** < 0.80 → Add domain knowledge

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Per Evaluation
- Domain checks: **$0.00** (instant)
- GPT-4 judge: **~$0.01** (~500ms)
- **Total: ~$0.01 per test**

### Realistic Usage
| Scenario | Tests | Cost | Time |
|----------|-------|------|------|
| Pre-deploy check | 10 tests | $0.10 | 5 seconds |
| Daily monitoring | 100 tests | $1.00 | 50 seconds |
| Full regression | 500 tests | $5.00 | 4 minutes |
| Monthly cost (daily monitoring) | 3,000 tests | ~$30 | Automated |

**Very affordable for the quality assurance value!**

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Use GPT-3.5 (Cheaper)
```bash
export EVAL_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # ~$0.001 per eval (10x cheaper)
```

### Use Vertex AI Gemini (No OpenAI needed)
```bash
export EVAL_PROVIDER=vertexai
# Uses your existing Google Cloud setup
```

### Adjust Thresholds
```bash
export MIN_EVAL_SCORE=0.85  # Higher for production
export MIN_PASS_RATE=0.90   # Require 90% pass rate
```

---

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Set your OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```

2. **Run first evaluation**:
   ```bash
   cd evals
   python3 eval_suite.py
   ```

3. **Review results** in `eval_results.json`

### Before Next Model Training
1. **Run evaluation** on current model
2. **Set baseline scores**
3. **After training**, re-evaluate
4. **Compare scores** - did it improve?
5. **Deploy** only if scores improved

### In Production
1. **Sample conversations daily** (100 random)
2. **Run evaluation** on sample
3. **Track scores over time**
4. **Alert if degradation** detected
